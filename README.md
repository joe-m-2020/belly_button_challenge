For this challenge I made a an init function that held the sub functions for building the bar plot, populating the metadata, and building the bubble chart.

I read the samples.json file in and created a drop down menu for passing the sample names for selecting the data to change dynamically.

I used find and parsint to store the sample data and metedata as constants and added them to index.html using d3js.

The Bar Chart shows the first 10 Sample Values in reverse order.

The Bubble chart shows the OTU ids as the x value, the Samples values as the Y value. It shows the OTU ids as the colors and the Sample values as the size of each bubble.
